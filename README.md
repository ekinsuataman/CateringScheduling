# CateringScheduring


# Project:

-   There is a party with 10 guests in my house.
-   I've hired a waiter from a catering company to serve you.
-   We have "b√∂rek", "cake" and "drink" to be consumed by my 10 guests. (30 boreks, 15 slices of cake and 30 glasses of drink)
-   On the table, there are 3 trays for them, each has a capacity of 5 (5 boreks on borek tray, 5 slices of cake on cake tray and 5 glasses of drink on drink tray).
-   As the guests eat and drink, a waiter will fill the trays (when there is 0 or 1 left on the tray)
-   Every guest must eat and drink from all types of food and drink at least once.
-   A guest can eat max 5 boreks and drink 5 glasses of drink, but can eat only 2 slices of cake.
-   This will last until all food and drink is consumed.
